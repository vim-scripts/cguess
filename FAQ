Q:  Why are the sources so full of dumb comments, meaningless terms
		and excessive structures all over?

A:  Well, there's a reason for it.  It is because this is a project
	I am writing for the university I am a student of. I expect
	to have a part of the subjects passed this way. Ofcourse it
	is not the only reason for writing this thing, but still it
	influences the  way the sources  look,  if you know  what I
	mean. It also has positive side effects; it guarantees that
	I will be systematicaly improving and updating this program
	and not leave  it alone half-functional after  implementing
	the interesting part.  At least for now.  At the end of the
	semester, after I present it,  it should become like other,
	normal projects.

Q:  Why...

A:  Yes, it will be fixed in next releases.
